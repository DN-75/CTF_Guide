## Method

1. Download the provided file.
2. Open it in a hex editor and inspect the first bytes (the file header). For example, on Linux you can use:

   `hexeditor <filename>`

3. A JPEG file should start with the magic bytes:

   `FF D8 FF`

4. If the header is different/corrupted, edit the first bytes so the file begins with `FF D8 FF`.
5. Save the file and rename it with a `.jpeg` extension.
6. Open the repaired image file. The flag should be visible (or embedded in the image content). Submit the flag.

## Notes

- Any hex editor works (HxD on Windows, `hexeditor` on Linux, etc.). The key is fixing the *magic bytes* at the start of the file.
- If the image still won't open, double-check you didn't shift bytes (overwrite in-place rather than inserting/removing).
