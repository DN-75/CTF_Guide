## Method

1. Download the provided image file.
2. Check the image metadata using `exiftool`:

   `exiftool <filename>`

3. In the metadata output, you should find a Base64-encoded password meant for `steghide`.
4. Decode the Base64 string to recover the password.
5. Use `steghide` with the recovered password to extract embedded data from the image:

   `steghide extract -sf <filename>`

   When prompted for the passphrase, paste the decoded password.

6. The extracted content should be written to a file in the same folder (commonly `flag.txt`). Open it and submit the flag.

## Notes

- If extraction fails, confirm you decoded the Base64 password correctly (padding `=` matters).
- `steghide` is typically available on Linux (or via WSL on Windows). If you're on Windows, WSL is the easiest way to run it.
