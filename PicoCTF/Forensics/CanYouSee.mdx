## Method

1. Download the provided file.
2. Extract the contents of the file/archive until you get the image file.
3. Analyze the image metadata using `exiftool`:

   `exiftool <image_filename>`

4. In the output, you should find a Base64-encoded string that contains the flag.
5. Decode the Base64 string.
6. Submit the decoded flag.

## Explanation (method + logic)

- Image files often contain **metadata** (EXIF/XMP/IPTC) such as camera model, timestamps, comments, and custom tags.
- Because metadata isn't normally visible when viewing an image, it's a common place to hide short secrets like flags.
- The flag is Base64-encoded to keep it readable/text-safe inside metadata fields. Once you extract it with `exiftool`, decoding Base64 reveals the original flag.

## Notes

- If the decoded output includes extra text, look for the `picoCTF{...}` pattern.
- If Base64 decoding fails, re-copy the encoded string exactly (watch for missing padding `=` or extra whitespace).
