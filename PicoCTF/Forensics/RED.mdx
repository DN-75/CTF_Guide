## Method

1. Download the provided image file (for example: `red.png`).
2. Inspect the image for hidden data using `zsteg`:

   `zsteg red.png`

3. Look through the output for an interesting string. You should find a Base64-encoded value.
4. Decode the Base64 text.
5. The decoded output should contain the flag. Submit it.

## Explanation (method + logic)

- Some challenges hide data inside an image using **LSB steganography** (Least Significant Bit). This means secret bits are stored in the least important bits of pixel values, so the image looks normal to the eye.
- `zsteg` is a tool that automatically checks many common bit-plane/encoding combinations in PNG/BMP images and prints anything that looks like embedded content.
- The hidden payload is often encoded again (like Base64) so it becomes printable text and survives extraction cleanly. Once you Base64-decode it, you typically get the real message/flag.

## Notes

- If you're on Windows, run `zsteg` from Linux/WSL (it's commonly installed via Ruby gems).
- If Base64 decoding fails, re-copy the exact string (watch for missing padding `=` or accidental whitespace).
