## Method

1. Download the provided file.
2. Open the file as a **PDF**. You should be able to see the **second half** of the flag.
3. Rename the same file extension to **PNG** (for example, rename `challenge.pdf` to `challenge.png`).
4. Open the renamed file as an image. You should now see the **first half** of the flag.
5. Combine both parts (in the correct order) to form the full flag, then submit it.

## Notes

- This challenge uses a **polyglot file**: a single file crafted to be valid in more than one format (here: PDF and PNG), depending on how it's interpreted.
- If your OS warns about changing extensions, accept it (you're not modifying the bytes—just how the file is opened).
