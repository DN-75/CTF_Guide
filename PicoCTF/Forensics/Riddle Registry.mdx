## Method

1. Download the provided PDF file.
2. Analyze the file metadata using `exiftool`:

   `exiftool <filename>`

3. In the output, you should find a Base64-encoded flag (or a Base64-encoded string that contains the flag).
4. Decode the Base64 string.
5. Submit the decoded flag.

## Notes

- If the decoded output contains extra text, look for the `picoCTF{...}` pattern.
- If Base64 decoding fails, re-check that you copied the string exactly (no spaces/newlines missing padding like `=`).
