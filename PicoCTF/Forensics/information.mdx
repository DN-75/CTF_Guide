## Method

1. Download the provided file.
2. Inspect the file metadata using `exiftool`:

   `exiftool <filename>`

3. In the output, you should find a Base64-encoded string.
4. Decode the Base64 string.
5. The decoded output should contain the flag. Submit it.

## Explanation (method + logic)

- Many file types (images, PDFs, office documents, etc.) can store **metadata** such as author, comments, timestamps, and custom fields.
- Metadata is a common hiding place in forensics challenges because its not usually visible when you open the file normally.
- The hidden value is often Base64-encoded so it stays printable and easy to embed in metadata fields. After extracting it with `exiftool`, decoding Base64 reveals the original message/flag.

## Notes

- If the decoded output includes extra text, search for the `picoCTF{...}` pattern.
- If Base64 decoding fails, re-copy the string exactly (padding `=` matters).
