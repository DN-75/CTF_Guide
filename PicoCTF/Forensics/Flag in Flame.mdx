## Method

1. Download the provided text file (for example: `logs.txt`).
2. The hint suggests the text is Base64 for an image. Decode it into a PNG:

   `base64 -d logs.txt > img2.png`

3. Open `img2.png` in any image viewer.
4. You should see a hex-encoded string in the image.
5. Decode the hex string to retrieve the flag and submit it.

## Notes

- If `base64 -d` isn't available on your system, use Linux/WSL.
- When hex decoding, make sure you copy the string exactly (no spaces/newlines unless your decoder supports them).
