## Method

1. Download the provided text file and analyze its contents.
2. Notice that the RSA public exponent `e` is small.
3. When `e` is small and the message is not padded (and is small enough), RSA can sometimes be decrypted by taking the **`e`-th root** of the ciphertext `c`.
4. To compute the `e`-th integer root, you can use the following Python script (example uses `e = 20`).

```python
import gmpy2

# Put your ciphertext value here (usually denoted as c)
C = int("Put c value here")

e = 20

root, exact = gmpy2.iroot(C, e)

print(root)
print("Exact root:", exact)

if exact:
    m = root

    byte_length = (m.bit_length() + 7) // 8
    plaintext_bytes = m.to_bytes(byte_length, byteorder="big")

    print(plaintext_bytes)
```

5. If `Exact root: True`, the plaintext bytes should contain the flag (or a flag-like string). Submit it.

## Notes

- The value you take the root of is typically the ciphertext `c` (not `n`).
- This approach commonly works when `m^e < n` and there is **no padding**.
- If `exact` is `False`, the plaintext is not a perfect `e`-th power; you may need a different approach.
