## Method

1. Download the provided text file and copy the encoded message.
2. Paste it into the transposition tool:

3. Adjust the settings:
   - Set the **key** to `3`
   - Reorder the columns by moving the **3rd column to the 1st column**
4. The decoded output will reveal the flag.

## Transposition-Trial (Description)

This challenge uses a **transposition cipher**, where the characters are not changed, but their **positions are rearranged** according to a key (often by writing text into columns and reading them out in a different order). By setting the correct key length and restoring the correct column order (here, moving column 3 to column 1), you reverse the permutation and recover the original plaintext/flag.
