## Method

1. Download the provided text file and identify the RSA values it contains (commonly `n`, `e`, and ciphertext `c`).
2. Open dCode’s RSA tool:
   - https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher
3. Paste the relevant values into the relevant fields (for example, modulus `n`, public exponent `e`, ciphertext `c`).
4. Solve/decrypt to obtain the plaintext output.
5. **Reverse** the output string (the challenge may have the plaintext backwards) to get the flag.

## RSA (Description)

**RSA** is a public-key cryptosystem based on the difficulty of factoring a large integer `n` that is the product of two primes:

- Choose large primes `p` and `q`
- Compute `n = p * q`
- Pick public exponent `e`
- Compute private exponent `d` such that `e*d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))`, where `φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)`

Encryption is typically: `c = m^e mod n`, and decryption: `m = c^d mod n`.

### Why small `n` is weak

If `n` is too small (or `p` and `q` are too small/poorly chosen), an attacker can factor `n` into `p` and `q` using fast factoring methods. Once `p` and `q` are known, `φ(n)` and then the private key `d` can be computed, which breaks RSA.

In practice, RSA security requires **large** `n` (commonly 2048 bits or more) and well-generated primes. Small `n` dramatically lowers the work needed to factor and makes the system vulnerable.
