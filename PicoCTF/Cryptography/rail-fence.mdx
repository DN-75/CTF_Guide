## Method

1. Download the text file and copy the encoded text.
2. Paste it into the Rail Fence Cipher tool on Cryptii:
   - https://cryptii.com/pipes/rail-fence-cipher
3. Set:
   - **Key (Rails):** `4`
   - **Offset:** `0`
4. Decode/decrypt to get the plaintext.
5. Wrap the decoded message in the flag format:

`picoCTF{...}`

## Rail Fence Cipher (Description)

The **Rail Fence cipher** is a classical transposition cipher. Instead of substituting letters, it **rearranges** them by writing the message in a zig-zag pattern across a fixed number of “rails” (rows), then reading off the rows to form the ciphertext. To decrypt, you reconstruct the zig-zag pattern using the same number of rails (key) and offset, then read the message in the original zig-zag order.
