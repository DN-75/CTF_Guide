## Method

1. Download the provided file and open it with Notepad (or any text editor).
2. Copy the hash/string from the file.
3. Decode it using Base64:
   - https://www.base64decode.org/
4. The decoded output will look something like:

   `b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrXzg5MGsyMzc5fQ=='`

5. Copy the middle Base64 part (the part that starts with `d` and ends with `=`). Example:

   `d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrXzg5MGsyMzc5fQ==`

   > If you copied it without the trailing `==`, add the padding back and try again.

6. Decode that Base64 string again. You should get flag-like content, for example:

   `wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_890k2379}`

7. This is still encrypted (Caesar cipher). Paste it into dCode’s Caesar Cipher tool:
   - https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher
8. Use **brute force** (try all shifts) until you see a readable picoCTF-style flag, then submit it.

## Notes

- Be careful not to include the leading `b'` or trailing `'` characters from the Python bytes-looking output.
- If the second Base64 decode fails, your copied string likely missed padding (`=` or `==`) or includes whitespace.
