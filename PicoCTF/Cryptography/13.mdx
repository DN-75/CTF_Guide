## Method

1. Copy the given encoded string from the challenge.
2. Apply **ROT13** to decode it.
3. You can use an online tool such as:
   - https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher
4. The decoded output should reveal the flag (or a flag-like string). Submit it.

## Notes

- If the output still looks scrambled, double-check you copied the full string (no missing characters/spaces).
- ROT13 only shifts letters (A–Z, a–z). Numbers and symbols stay the same.
