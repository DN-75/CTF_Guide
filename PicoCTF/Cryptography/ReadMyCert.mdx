## Method

1. Download the provided **CSR** file (`.csr`).
2. In a Linux terminal, read/inspect it using OpenSSL:

   ```bash
   openssl req -in yourfile.csr -noout -text
   ```

3. In the command output, you will find the flag.

## Notes

- If the provided file is a **certificate** (`.crt`) rather than a **CSR** (`.csr`), use:

  ```bash
  openssl x509 -in yourfile.crt -noout -text
  ```

- Copy the flag exactly (watch for extra whitespace).
