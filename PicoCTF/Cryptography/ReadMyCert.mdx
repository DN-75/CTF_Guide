## Method

1. Download the provided `.crt` file.
2. In a Linux terminal, read/inspect it using OpenSSL. For example:

```bash
openssl req -in yourfile.csr -noout -text
```

3. In the command output, you will find the flag.

## Notes

- If your file is a **certificate** (`.crt`) rather than a **CSR** (`.csr`), this alternative command is commonly used:

```bash
openssl x509 -in yourfile.crt -noout -text
```

- Copy the flag exactly (watch for extra whitespace).
